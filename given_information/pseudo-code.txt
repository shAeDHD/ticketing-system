Freshdesk, a helpdesk system, allows the export of activity information of all tickets. The tickets can be requested to look similar to the following form -

    see ./initial_tests/data_example.py

!!HINT: The status column can be any of the following values:!!
● "Open"
● "Closed"
● "Resolved"
● "Waiting for Customer"
● "Waiting for Third Party"
● "Pending"

            ------------------ STEPS ----------------------
1. Write a Python program which will randomly generate realistic ticket data based on the above JSON format and store the data in a JSON file on disk. It should generate a random activity distribution for a configurable number of tickets. The program will be checked for realism of data, and for the ability to handle large amounts of records.Example: ticket_gen -n 1000 -o activities.json to generate 1000 tickets with random activities into the activities.json file.

2. Write a program (in a language if your choice) to read the above generated JSON file and store the data into a SQLite database in a relational format. The program will be checked for relational modelling.

3. Write a SQL script that can be run on the database to generate the following attributes for each ticket: 
○ Time spent Open
○ Time spent Waiting on Customer
○ Time spent waiting for response (Pending Status)
○ Time till resolution
○ Time to first response

4. Example:| ticket_id | time_spent_open | time_spent_waiting_on_customer |
time_spent_waiting_for_response | time_till_resolution | time_to_first_response | |
704 | 12 | 90 | 1200 | 1300 | 10 |

5. Ensure all the above programs can be run in sequence using a bash script, Makefile, or equivalent
